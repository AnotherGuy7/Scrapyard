---------------------------------------Idea: -----------------------------------------
A game where you fight against many enemies in "Odd Jobs". 
Weapons are made on the spot using Scrap Metal collected around the map and sometimes dropped when enemies are killed (The scrap metal is dropped, not the weapon)


---------------------------------------Day 1: ----------------------------------------- (Achieved)
- Working camera
- Working map
- Working player with controls

---------------------------------------Day 2: -----------------------------------------
- UI
- Working odd job end mission screen (Shows a new job added to the resume)
- Shows objectives
- Working mechanics

---------------------------------------Day 3: -----------------------------------------

---------------------------------------Day 4: -----------------------------------------

---------------------------------------Day 5: -----------------------------------------

---------------------------------------Day 6: -----------------------------------------

---------------------------------------Final Day (4 hours): -----------------------------------------

Scratch all that..! The above will take WAY too long to make, the Jam Entry wouldn't have been finished in time.

---------------------------------------Idea: -----------------------------------------
A game where you live in a scrap yard and hostile creatures have invaded it. You shoot at them to destory them all the way until you get to the main invador, known as The Trash.
